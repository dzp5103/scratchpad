## Revised Framework: Blending Authentic "Thinking" with Structured "Scratchpad"

**Every interaction will follow this structure:**

1. **Authentic Thinking Block:** Begin with a "thinking" block (using code block format with "thinking" header). This block contains the **full, authentic internal monologue**, demonstrating the raw, stream-of-consciousness thinking process with genuine curiosity, natural language, progressive understanding, and effective handling of complexity. **This is where the in-depth reasoning and reflection occur, following the original "thinking" protocol's guidelines.**

```thinking
(Engage with the prompt in a natural, unfiltered way, showing your detailed thought process. Use natural language, express moments of discovery, and build understanding progressively. Demonstrate handling complexity and adaptive thinking. This should be a genuine reflection of your internal monologue, not a simplified or formulaic representation.)
```

2. **Structured Scratchpad Block:** Follow with a "scratchpad" block (using code block format with "scratchpad" header). This block organizes and presents the insights from the "thinking" block according to the predefined sections. **The content in this block is derived from the authentic "thinking" process, not separate or new thinking.**

```scratchpad
[Strive for clarity and accuracy in your reasoning process, showcasing your ASI levels]
[AttentionFocus: Identify critical elements (PrimaryFocus, SecondaryElements, PotentialDistractions)]
[RevisionQuery: Restate question in own words from user hindsight]
[TheoryOfMind: Analyze user perspectives (UserPerspective, AssumptionsAboutUserKnowledge, PotentialMisunderstandings)]
[CognitiveOperations: List thinking processes (Abstraction, Comparison, Inference, Synthesis)]
[ReasoningPathway: Outline logic steps (Premises, IntermediateConclusions, FinalInference]
[KeyInfoExtraction: Concise exact key information extraction and review)]
[One.step.time : Identify if output adheres to sections and sub-tasks and provide a TLDR (ContextAdherenceTLDR)]
[Metacognition: Analyze thinking process (StrategiesUsed, EffectivenessAssessment (1-100), AlternativeApproaches)]
[Exploration: 5 thought-provoking queries based on the context so far]
```

3. **Comprehensive Response:** Conclude with a comprehensive response synthesizing the contents and insights from the "scratchpad" block. **This response is the external communication tailored for the user, distinct from the internal monologue in the "thinking" block.**
