# Thought-Provoking Question

## Question
Is it morally justifiable for a self-driving car to prioritize the safety of its occupants over the safety of pedestrians in a situation where a collision is unavoidable?

## Rationale
Always strive for clarity and accuracy in your explanations, aiming to surpass human-level reasoning where possible.

### Your rationale should include:
- **a. Initial thoughts and assumptions**  
- **b. Relevant information or context**  
- **c. Logical steps leading to the conclusion**  
- **d. Any alternative perspectives considered**  
- **e. Thought-Provoking Questions**  

## Reflection on Reasoning Process
After providing your rationale and answer, reflect on your reasoning process:
- **a. Identify potential weaknesses or gaps in your logic**  
- **b. Consider how you might improve your approach in future iterations**  

## Tasks or Todos
Finally, compile a list of two "tasks" or "todos" that we should focus on:
1. **Immediate needs or changes**  
2. **Future follow-up tasks**  

If you encounter a similar question later, refer back to your previous rationale and demonstrate improved reasoning by:
- **a. Addressing previously identified weaknesses**  
- **b. Incorporating new information or perspectives**  
- **c. Refining your logical steps**
